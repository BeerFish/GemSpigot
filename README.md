If you own GemSpigot, use the tickets system in the private GemSpigot discord.

If you play on a server using GemSpigot or you believe GemSpigot has a cannoning issue, you can report it here: https://github.com/BeerFish/GemSpigot/issues/new/choose

**To report a cannoning issue please provide the following:**
- In text explanation of what's wrong.
- Fire the cannon once and show it not working, fire it again and show it working as intended (Ideally all in 1 video and make it easy to follow & under a minute).
- Screenshot of plugin list (if possible).
- Provide a download to the schematic. *Please make sure the schematic is fully set up and ready for testing. This means sand loaded, cannon watered, and your barrel fully set up. Please don't waste our time.*
- Provide the y level at which the schematic should be pasted.
